EXPENSE TRACKER – Python Mini Project
The Expense Tracker is a Python-based application designed to help users efficiently manage their daily expenses. 
The main objective of this project is to allow users to record, categorize, and analyze their spending, making it easier to track financial habits and improve money management.
This is a well-structured Expense Tracker application using Python and Tkinter.

Libraries Used:
* tkinter – For building the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* os – To check and manage file operations for expense storage.
* datetime – To handle and filter expenses based on dates.

Features:
Add Expenses – Users can enter date, amount, category, and description to record expenses.
View Expenses – Displays all recorded expenses in a text field.
Filter Expenses – Users can filter expenses based on date or category.
Delete Expenses – Users can remove specific expenses by providing complete details.
Monthly Summary – Calculates total expenses for the current month and categorizes them.
Persistent Storage – Uses a expenses.txt file to store expense records.

How it Works:
The program initializes an expense file if it doesn’t exist.
Users can enter details and click buttons to perform various operations.
The GUI is built using Tkinter, making it interactive and user-friendly.
Data is stored in a structured format (CSV-like) for easy retrieval and filtering.
